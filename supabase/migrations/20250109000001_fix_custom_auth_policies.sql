-- Fix RLS policies to work with custom authentication
-- Since the app uses custom auth (not Supabase auth), we need different policies

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view all complaints" ON complaints;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Students can create complaints" ON complaints;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update complaints" ON complaints;

-- Create policies that don't rely on auth.uid()
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on complaints"
  ON complaints FOR ALL
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Fix attendance policies too
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view all attendance" ON attendance;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can mark attendance" ON attendance;

CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on attendance"
  ON attendance FOR ALL
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Fix outpass policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view all outpass requests" ON outpass_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Students can create their own requests" ON outpass_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update outpass requests" ON outpass_requests;

CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on outpass_requests"
  ON outpass_requests FOR ALL
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Fix leave forms policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view all leave forms" ON leave_forms;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Students can upload leave forms" ON leave_forms;

CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on leave_forms"
  ON leave_forms FOR ALL
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);
